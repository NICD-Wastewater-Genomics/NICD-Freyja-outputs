# NICD Wastewater Analyses with Freyja Hub

This will serve as central hub for all Freyja analyses, and supply data outputs for ongoing reporting including regular reports, dashboards, and publications. 

We store outputs from the `freyja variants` and `freyja demix` commands here. `variants` outputs SNV variant information and site-specific sequencing depth information, which are stored in corresponding folders. The demixed outputs from `freyja demix` are stored in the outputs directory. 

To include soon:
  - automatic freyja demix re-runs with updated barcodes
  - export into format for reporting, automatic pushes to corresponding github repos
